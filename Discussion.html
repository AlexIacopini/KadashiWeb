               Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
               The sun it changed in the atmosphere
               Architecture unfamiliar
               I can get used to this
               Time flies by in the yellow and green
               Stick around and you'll see what I mean
               There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
               If you need me you know were I'll be
               I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
               Feeling like a someone
               I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
               Feeling like a someone
               The south of the equator, navigate it
               Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
               Deep-sea diving 'round the clock, bikini bottoms, lager tops
